# TrafficEase
Traffic Managment system 
TrafficEase simplifies the complex task of managing traffic in bustling cities. By integrating real-time data from sensors and cameras, it provides actionable insights to regulate traffic, reduce bottlenecks, and ensure smooth urban mobility for both vehicles and pedestrians.
We have developed an interactive simulation for TrafficEase, a cutting-edge traffic management solution designed to simplify urban mobility and regulate traffic flow in real time. The simulation showcases how TrafficEase intelligently manages road networks and optimizes traffic flow across busy intersections.
